Quote1;Text;Description (optional);To start with, you should have an attitude of gratitude. Without an attitude of gratitude, neither prosperity nor pleasure, joy nor happiness means anything, and it works this way: to those who have an attitude of gratitude and who do it with innocence, Mother Nature brings all the wealth, health, and happiness. 8/30/91|Yogi Bhajan|33480|Yogi Bhajan|33480;;
Quote2;Text;Description (optional);A conscious person talks with absolute dignity and absolute faith. Never ever, never ever say things against any human form, even unconsciously, because that is a slander of the divine, against what God manufactured. - KRI Conscious Communication manual|Yogi Bhajan|KRI Conscious Communication manual;;
Quote3;Text;Description (optional);You have to have stamina as people, as human beings, as graceful people, so that you can stand. And what is the stamina? When you can stand against every eventuality. 6/18/73|Yogi Bhajan|26833;;
Quote4;Text;Description (optional);Meditation is for yourself. Meditation is not for somebody else. When you come for sadhana, you come for yourself. When you pray, you pray for yourself.  7/15/82|Yogi Bhajan| 7/15/82;;
Quote5;Text;Description (optional);A candle may have wax and threads, but if it is not lit, it does not take away the darkness.  2/23/99|Yogi Bhajan|36214;;
Quote6;Text;Description (optional);You have five elements of you: ether, air, fire, water, earth. And these five have five juices: lust, anger, greed, pride, and attachment. Wherever your mind is not creative and it is not supported by your intuition, you cannot be free. 9/11/90|Yogi Bhajan|33127;;
Quote7;Text;Description (optional);Inhale deeply with reverence, love, compassion, and kindness. Communicate with your breath that it must give you peace of mind, peace on the mother planet Earth, peace and oneness with God and His creation. 5/13/92|Yogi Bhajan|33737;;
Quote8;Text;Description (optional);May God guide you on this path. May you understand that you are blessed children and you have a job to do. May you know in your heart that God belongs to you always, within and without. 6/20/93|Yogi Bhajan|34140;;
Quote9;Text;Description (optional);We run around for earthly positions and earthly environments. Have you ever understood that if you just run to God, who has created the Earth, everything on the Earth will be yours? Can you do it by love? No. Can you do it by belief? No. You have to trust it. You have to trust you are God, that God is you, in God you dwell, and in God you trust. 10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787;;
Quote10;Text;Description (optional);When you get up in the morning, and you open your eyes, and you breathe consciously, if you have not thanked yet, you have lost the greatest opportunity of the right to live. 6/25/87|Yogi Bhajan|31953;;
Quote11;Text;Description (optional);In our ‘micro-consciousness’ we have to be pure, so we can build a ‘macro-consciousness’ that should just be a constant flood of purity. Let us decide once and for all that love is the essence of life. 7/28/02|Yogi Bhajan|37465;;
Quote12;Text;Description (optional);Seva or service is infinite giving. When I am honored in my consciousness for doing something, it is seva. When I stand before my consciousness, I feel good, and I say, ‘Well, I am so blessed that I could do it.’ That’s seva. 7/22/78|Yogi Bhajan|28693;;
Quote13;Text;Description (optional);A teacher is an artist with hammer and chisel. Whenever you meet a teacher, God, there will be a spark. At the first introduction of you and your Teacher, you are going to find what is wrong with you. Mostly you will not like to hear that. You’ll skip that person. You are most welcome to skip it, but you do not know that you have lost that one chance which the soul was promised. 7/29/96|Yogi Bhajan|35275;;
Quote14;Text;Description (optional);The real game is for you to make your mind follow you, so you can become a sage. If you choose instead to follow your mind, it will make you crazy and weak. In this game, mastery is the goal and your main enemy is stress. When you are under stress you begin to lose your mind slowly, to a very polite degree. Your mind starts to wander on its own. It looks elsewhere for shelter and hope. It looks into your subconscious and pulls out of it every memory and every fragment of intentions and actions left incomplete in your life. You begin to live in the past. You do not act in the present but according to overlays from your past. -The Mind|Yogi Bhajan|The Mind;;
Quote15;Text;Description (optional);The fact of life is that man is a social animal. We need to understand that in the Infinite sense of existence, we have to exist with each other, no matter what. Love is not lost between two people if they forgive and forget, and are kind, compassionate, and caring. This will give them wealth - wealth and happiness. 12/29/02|Yogi Bhajan|37619;;
Quote16;Text;Description (optional);Imagine thousands and thousands marching with the rhythmic vibrations and the enemy falling flat. That is what a mantra is: the power of the word. 7/14/87|Yogi Bhajan|31972;;
Quote17;Text;Description (optional);Ang Sang Wahe Guru. In every cell of me, the great God is. Those who believe this, they don’t have to believe in anything else. Those who believe in everything else, they cannot believe in this. It’s a choice. And every human has to make it. 2/8/95|Yogi Bhajan|34738;;
Quote18;Text;Description (optional);When you say you are starving, you are denying any gift, virtue, grace or attraction you command. You are becoming a personified dying misery. 6/29/87|Yogi Bhajan|31957;;
Quote19;Text;Description (optional);Awareness takes these nine things away from you: thinking, reason, logic, argument, fantasies, planning, scheming, knowing, and, worrying. These nine things must go before you can say that you are on the path of awareness. Do you know why? Because the One who rotates the Earth can take care of your routine. These nine things you do are unwanted. They only satisfy your ego. Where there is ego, there is no amigo. 7/20/96|Yogi Bhajan|35266;;
Quote20;Text;Description (optional);Under no circumstances are you required to speak negative language, and you must not communicate in a way which will be offensive. Neither should you speak in a way which should be just buttering. Speaking should be neither overdoing nor under-doing nor super-positive nor super-negative. Speaking should be straight because between two lines, the direct route is the shortest. - KRI Conscious Communication Manual|Yogi Bhajan|KRI Conscious Communication manual;;
Quote21;Text;Description (optional);Ordinarily you say ‘Thank you.’ But do you say thank you to your parents? Do you say thank you to your neighbors? Do you say thank you to a tree, which gives you shelter? Do you say a thank you to the car, which takes you somewhere? Why not? The human birth is meant for thanking. You have enemies. Thank them. Without them you will never be alert. You will never be smart. You will never enjoy your existence. 10/31/93|Yogi Bhajan|34273;;
Quote22;Text;Description (optional);White Tantra is the science of unison which brings us from many to oneness of mind. It clears the consciousness—the blocks of the subconscious mind. It brings out the garbage and makes the individual free of the block. 7/29/78|Yogi Bhajan|28700;;
Quote23;Text;Description (optional);In your life there will be good days and bad days, normal days and abnormal days, right days and wrong days, but you must understand that every day has to be followed by a night and every life has to end. Don’t waste your life in reactions. 8/4/81|Yogi Bhajan|29802;;
Quote24;Text;Description (optional);Deal from the point of soul: “I have a soul.” You will never have fear. Fear, pain and hurt only come to you when you are not dealing with life in the light of your soul. When you are dealing with life out of your light of ego, pain will be there. 7/12/84|Yogi Bhajan|30875;;
Quote25;Text;Description (optional);You get up in the ambrosial hours, when the sun is hitting at a sixty-degree angle, exercise and stimulate yourself, then sit and meditate for hours just to clean the subconscious. You do this so there may be some space left where more garbage can be dumped. 7/29/96|Yogi Bhajan|35275;;
Quote26;Text;Description (optional);"Goodwill is two words: good and will. Goodwill is made when you are grateful. Great and full. When you are grateful, you are successful; then your personality will have an impact and you will have goodwill. 2/15/99|Yogi Bhajan|36206";;
Quote27;Text;Description (optional);You do not understand your features. Your features are not your beautiful nose, your beautiful cheeks, beautiful lips, and so on. These are not your features. Your features are your beautiful behavior, your beautiful character, your beautiful health, your beautiful spirit, your beautiful advice, your beautiful wisdom, your beautiful inspiration. 8/21/78|Yogi Bhajan|28723;;
Quote28;Text;Description (optional);Your Self is the only conscious voice you have, deep within you. Develop the habit to listen to yourself whenever you are confronted with anything. Tell yourself, through a meditative mind, ‘I must listen to myself.’ It is the first step of friendship between the body and the soul. 10/25/00|Yogi Bhajan|36824;;
Quote29;Text;Description (optional);The mind is your servant to master time and space and to always find a way to connect with the Infinite. To tap this intelligence in the mind, say to yourself: “I am Thee. Thou is Me. Me is Thou. I am Thee.” Play with it. Repeat it in rhythm. It has the naad. It penetrates the subconscious and reminds you that you are neither alone nor separated. Then the soul wondered, “What if I have forgotten all this? How can I remember?” Close your eyes and speak truthfully, and for God’s sake feel it. Speak it fearlessly and with your whole heart. -The Mind|Yogi Bhajan|The Mind;;
Quote30;Text;Description (optional);The first role of the teacher is to be humble...the character, the courage, the grace, and the magnitude of a person is in practicing humility. One who cannot go under can never grow. The first power of the seed is to go under, and then grow. 7/22/96|Yogi Bhajan|35268;;
Quote31;Text;Description (optional);You have to walk on your own feet and you have to walk tall.  Humans learn to crawl and then walk. All men, women and children are children of God. They have to learn that their neurotic blocks have to be broken in two, to become triangles, and this challenge belongs to all of us. 11/23/93|Yogi Bhajan|34296;;
Quote32;Text;Description (optional);The law of balance is a law of applied consciousness. You can never change it. You will get one thing, you lose the other, you get third thing, you lose the fourth. Always there will be a gap. The ‘law of gap’ is that there is no gap and how can that gap be filled? Be in gratitude. Make an attitude to be in gratitude, you will find the whole Universe will come to you. 8/30/91|Yogi Bhajan|33480;;
Quote33;Text;Description (optional);"It is not that it is religious or it is not religious, it is called attitude of gratitude; it is called thanking God for giving you elbows and knees, giving you ribs and the glandular system, giving you head and skull and brain. 5/6/85|Yogi Bhajan|31173";;
Quote34;Text;Description (optional);"The mind is a virtue; it is faster than time and space. It’s given to us to realize beyond the beyond, the essence of life, the creativity of life, life itself. The beauty, the bounty, the bliss of the mind is found in the awareness of the soul. /10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787";;
Quote35;Text;Description (optional);We are all pioneers in the Age of Aquarius. No man can give a man anything other than love. No man can give a man anything other than hope. No man can give a man anything but service. The only thing you can do is act like a forklift—go into the dirt and lift the other person and put him on track, so he can proceed. 6/20/93|Yogi Bhajan|34140;;
Quote36;Text;Description (optional);"The purpose of life is to reach a state of consciousness where there is no peer group, period. Only then can you become a giver. Before that you can’t give anybody anything; you are in a business of give and take. But when you give and give and give, and for the sake of giving you live, then you become Ik - One. Then you have to have no peer group.  One is very lonely. It has its own beginning; it has its own end and its own process. 3/29/87|Yogi Bhajan|31865";;

Quote38;Text;Description (optional);Mankind is still seeking to find the peace within so it can have peace without. There shall not be peace in the world if there is no peace in the heart of the man. There is not going to be peace in your heart if you do not understand and experience your very relationship with your soul. 5/19/89|Yogi Bhajan|32647;;
Quote39;Text;Description (optional);Bring in tranquility and tranquilize yourself through self-hypnosis in your tranquility, in your steadfastness, and in your love for entire mankind. We need the deepest prayer, concentration and strength of the inner mind for universal peace so that mankind can live. 6/10/89|Yogi Bhajan|32669;;
Quote40;Text;Description (optional);The time has come. You have to be you—a beautiful, bountiful, blissful human. Nobody can create you. God created you in His own image. Don’t create your own images. Just have one image of you as you being the being of God. It’s very human and that is what the Age of Aquarius is all about—the “New Age.” It will be the Age of humans and peace, love, and service. We shall all live as one family and wars will cease. Humans and humanity will prevail again. 9/10/95|Yogi Bhajan|34952;;
Quote41;Text;Description (optional);Because if you believe in Infinity and you believe in the reality of that Infinity, and you, as a little finite part, become part of that Infinity, you will find ecstasy. You will find deathlessness in it. And in that bliss, you can sit on that throne of the Infinite. 10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787;;
Quote42;Text;Description (optional);The Age of Aquarius is coming our way. Emptiness, insanity, and pain shall be everybody’s affair. People will hit walls to find out where they can go. They shall come to you. As insane as they are, if you do not take away their pain, and instead you sit in judgment, you are wrong people. That’s why we wanted to teach you how to remain disciplined in the most undisciplined world. How to grow, to glow. How to serve, to be. 7/20/96|Yogi Bhajan|35266;;
Quote43;Text;Description (optional);We must learn to love ourselves before we love anybody else. We must honor ourselves before we honor anybody else. We must serve ourselves before we serve anybody else. If we do not know how to do things for ourselves, we shall not be in a position to do things for others. 7/24/96|Yogi Bhajan|35270;;
Quote44;Text;Description (optional);But when you have a personal impact of your infinity on yourself, then you find get dignity, great divinity and great grace. It’s a very solid state.

Quote45;Text;Description (optional);Above all, there’s a love which is real, the ultimate love. We merge not only physically, but mentally and spiritually, in arc-line, aura and subtle body. We amalgamate with each other. That is real love. 7/7/87|Yogi Bhajan|31965;;
Quote46;Text;Description (optional);With every thought, ask only one question: “Will this thought, if I pursue it, make me noble or will it make me bitter?

Quote47;Text;Description (optional);Everybody is contained in love. You don’t have to do a thing. When love comes from inside and prayer comes from inside, then everything becomes great.

Quote48;Text;Description (optional);If you are not content with yourself, don’t imagine that anybody else will be content with you. If you don’t love yourself, how can someone love you? If you don’t have anything, how can you share? 7/20/82|Yogi Bhajan|30152;;
Quote49;Text;Description (optional);Remember that when you put sugar in your metabolism, you are upsetting your metabolism in a very direct way. X amount of sugar is understandable, but the amount of sugar you put in, only God can save you. And whenever you put x amount of sugar, you must follow the law of depression. When you get that kind of depression, you lose a lot of friends. Therefore, it is very fair to channel your energy. One of the best ways to channel the energy is to do the pranayama. 7/18/75|Yogi Bhajan|27593;;
Quote50;Text;Description (optional);There is a tremendous amount of stress which you cause by not communicating with yourself. Therefore, try to establish a relationship between you and your self. -KRI Conscious Communication manual|Yogi Bhajan|KRI Conscious Communication manual;;
Quote51;Text;Description (optional);Any roughness in your life creates a reaction in your glandular system and the glands are the guardians of your health and your happiness. The problem is not how rough you are. The problem is can you meditate and clean yourself out? One who doesn’t take a bath after ten or fifteen days stinks, and one who doesn’t meditate after fifteen or twenty days goes berserk. 7/20/85|Yogi Bhajan|31248;;
Quote52;Text;Description (optional);Love evaporates in the pan of heat. What is left is the memory and the ashes. 2/22/99|Yogi Bhajan|36213;;
Quote53;Text;Description (optional);Any roughness in your life creates a reaction in your glandular system and the glands are the guardians of your health and your happiness. The problem is not how rough you are. The problem is can you meditate and clean yourself out? One who doesn’t take a bath after ten or fifteen days stinks, and one who doesn’t meditate after fifteen or twenty days goes berserk. 7/20/85 |Yogi Bhajan|31248;;
Quote54;Text;Description (optional);"You want to know what God is? You, as you are! But three thousand years of religious training is asking you to deny this. God is a living energy and lives in you. Can you accept this? We are never disconnected; we are always everywhere. Our psyches connect us. That’s called faith. We are never separated. But sometimes we forget. If we cannot be affectionate with each other, then the result will be negative. Let us see in our goodness how good we can be. 6/28/01|Yogi Bhajan|37070";;
Quote55;Text;Description (optional);You always want to know what is true. It is your instinct. Truth is that which has no fear. Even a truth spoken in fear is a lie. When you mix fear with anything it becomes non-reality. Your mind links with the ego and instantly creates complex fantasy and side paths. -The Mind|Yogi Bhajan|The Mind;;
Quote56;Text;Description (optional);"As a teacher, never compromise. As a man, always compromise. The teacher who compromises is an idiot; a person who does not compromise is an idiot. Because the teacher does not teach for himself, but for the higher consciousness. And higher consciousness will never compromise with lower consciousness. This is a straight law and that has to be considered as a law; that has to be observed as a law. 9/18/71|Yogi Bhajan|26194";;
Quote57;Text;Description (optional);This life has only one problem - you can be blocked. A block is always square. If you cut the square diagonally—that’s the tantric energy—you will have two triangles. A triangle is a sign of prosperity. A block is an obstacle. 11/23/93|Yogi Bhajan|34296;;
Quote58;Text;Description (optional);You will never find a community leader who doesn’t know how to give, seva. Giving is the only way. Don’t only give to those who ask, give to those who don’t ask. Keep on giving, become a giver. Your faculty and God’s faculty will become the same. That’s divinity. That’s absolute divinity. 9/4/01|Yogi Bhajan|37138;;
Quote59;Text;Description (optional);Man is a miracle by itself. His life, his death, his breath of life, and his every moment is, in itself, a huge miracle. It’s a fountain, a fragrance of life, and it has beauty, it has bounty, it has bliss in it. 10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787;;
Quote60;Text;Description (optional);The time has come to become your own master. Stop chasing masters. Become your own reality and stop chasing religion. Stop chasing God, be you. Become your own God. In the beginning, in the middle, in the end it is you and you alone. So live well in your inner peace, in your inner strength. And when you feel weak, call on your soul, your friend. To start, sit down and breathe one breath per minute. In exactly thirty seconds, your soul will start communicating with you. In three minutes you can change your mood. Then why are you suffering? 9/10/95|Yogi Bhajan|34952;;
Quote61;Text;Description (optional);Now the problem is, if somebody doesn’t trust you, you can discuss anything you want. But once you are trusted, and you betray that trust, you absolutely have a crisis on your hands. 7/15/87|Yogi Bhajan|31973;;
Quote62;Text;Description (optional);"There are a lot of things we need: One of these needs is that for the mind to work for you for the whole day, it must be fresh and clear; it must be made livable. That is why it is a requirement to rise early in the morning when nobody can disturb you, when you can be yourself. 7/4/82|Yogi Bhajan|30136";;
Quote63;Text;Description (optional);The purpose is to be in gratitude forever. Live with applied consciousness, prosperity will break through the walls, flood you with it. You do prayer when you are in difficulty. Pray when you are not in difficulty! That is the attitude of gratitude. 8/30/91|Yogi Bhajan|33480;;
Quote64;Text;Description (optional);We are born in His grace, we live by His light, and we redeem ourselves into the diligence of God Himself. God sees through our eyes, God hears through our ears, God speaks through our mouths, and within seventy-two hours, God renews us cell by cell. That’s how intimate, how serviceful, how affectionate and nurturing God is. 10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787;;
Quote65;Text;Description (optional);That infinite God of all infinity, shall serve longing. He is infinite. He is sovereign. He is imperial. He is free: that great sovereign becomes a slave before human longing. Understand and value that prayer is the power of the person. Your prayer has to become so powerful and pure. Then how can anything go wrong? 7/10/91|Yogi Bhajan|33429;;
Quote66;Text;Description (optional);First a person learns only in limited environments. When he becomes perfect in perfection of his own confidence of limited environments, then he can tackle unlimited environments. That is why individual consciousness will go to group consciousness. 3/11/74|Yogi Bhajan|27099;;
Quote67;Text;Description (optional);You are the leaders of tomorrow. You have to walk with your own consciousness, creativeness, clarity, purity, sympathy, service, sharing, caring. You have to. You have to have endurance and patience. 9/23/02|Yogi Bhajan|37522;;
Quote68;Text;Description (optional);Now the question for every intelligent human being under this sun on the Earth is that if we want to survive, we have to learn to love peace. The tragedy is we have not yet learned to love each other. It’s very difficult. We are afraid of each other. 5/12/89|Yogi Bhajan|32640;;
Quote69;Text;Description (optional);"Love is not enough; intelligence is not enough; powerful strength is not enough. You may put everything on one side of the scale, but if you are missing gratitude, you shall lose. 6/27/84|Yogi Bhajan|30860";;
Quote70;Text;Description (optional);Become a teacher and see how things come to you. You are a vehicle. In you there is the purity and piety of a Teacher that you must protect and serve. Then out of your word will come humans who will be invincible, blessed, bountiful, beautiful, and in bliss. You shall rule time and space, and your generations will be happy, healthy, and holy. 7/22/96|Yogi Bhajan|722/96;;
Quote71;Text;Description (optional);Just open your eyes, train your mind, and do your actions. Your actions will tell you how near or far you are from God. Be direct and face up to your own Infinite vastness. Have vastness as an attitude. The Mind|Yogi Bhajan|The Mind;;
Quote72;Text;Description (optional);"In our life, our noncommittal commitment gives us a kind of fake idea that there’s something better that we can grab tomorrow. It’s a grabbing attitude; not a building attitude. Commitment will build you slowly, surely, gracefully and wonderfully; but grabbing will never guarantee anything. 7/12/82|Yogi Bhajan|30144";;
Quote73;Text;Description (optional);"A relaxed mind is a creative mind and a creative mind is a relaxed mind; and only a relaxed mind can become a one-pointed mind; and a one-pointed mind is the most wonderful mind. It is most powerful; it can do anything. 7/27/96|Yogi Bhajan|35273";;
Quote74;Text;Description (optional);If a human feels, meditatively, that they are forever or tomorrow is with them and they can do it tomorrow, that human has no source of happiness. Your life has to live through love and love is when breath is in and breath is out, and it is continuous. If breath goes out and it does not come in again, that’s the end of you. It can happen for any reason and for anything. So don’t carry that heaviness that you are permanent. I never believe that I’m permanent. You should never believe you are permanent. 7/8/87|Yogi Bhajan|31966;;
Quote75;Text;Description (optional);Your beauty is not in your money, your jewels or your household. Your power is in your innocence. 2/23/99|Yogi Bhajan|36214;;
Quote76;Text;Description (optional);Each human body has a chance to realize infinity. God is infinity. Anybody who puts any limit on God is not understanding the word, ’God’ at all. If you do not understand totality, you do not understand infinity. 1/16/95|Yogi Bhajan|34715;;
Quote77;Text;Description (optional);In this human life, prayer is the power. One who can pray can be very powerful, because prayer makes all the elements serve that person. The moment you become a prayerful person, the fear of the Unknown is gone and love of the Unknown awakens. Prayer is the intunement of the mind into the Higher Consciousness and the Unknown. ...When you are intuned with the Unknown, the known is very peaceful. 7/15/82|Yogi Bhajan|30147;;
Quote78;Text;Description (optional);For prosperity, it is your openness, it is your smile and it is your greeting which can bring the world to you. 4/25/97|Yogi Bhajan|35545;;
Quote79;Text;Description (optional);Not only are you powerful, you are prestigious. Not only are you prestigious, you are beautiful. Not only are you beautiful, you are consciousness. Not only are you consciousness, you are the spirit. Not only are you the spirit, you are the security of the future, the most bountiful beauty ever God created. Men call it ‘woman.’ 7/23/84|Yogi Bhajan|30886;;
Quote80;Text;Description (optional);There is only one problem: You do not trust your powers. There is no difference between you and God. Count your blessings. Be proud of yourself.

Feel God within. There is no God outside of you. 6/23/00|Yogi Bhajan|36700;;
Quote81;Text;Description (optional);We have totally forgotten that this Universe is the outcome of vibration. This Universe is not communication. This Universe is not money. This Universe is not love, it is not sex, it is not beauty, it is not even God. That one line is true: “In the beginning there was the Word, Word was with God, and Word was God.” That’s all it is about. What is a word? Creative vibration. 7/18/84|Yogi Bhajan|30881;;
Quote82;Text;Description (optional);Harmonious communication has nothing to do with what you feel, what you know, and what you want. In order to achieve harmonious and conscious communication, first you have to understand the other person.

Quote84;Text;Description (optional);Everything is thought—God is thought, Earth is thought, names are thought, everything is just thought. But demonstratively entertain no thought, ‘I am not, all is zero.’ Give yourself a thoughtless grace and it will be a very good bargain when the subconscious doesn’t act, and the unconscious gives you intuition. Automatically your job will be done. That’s the end of poverty and the beginning of prosperity. 11/11/94|Yogi Bhajan|34649;;
Quote85;Text;Description (optional);The reality is there is nobody who can limit you. There is nobody who can damage you. Your existence is not bound in time and space. You always have a choice of how you project your mind. The Mind|Yogi Bhajan|The Mind;;

Quote89;Text;Description (optional);The totality of God which we know, the oneness of God which we understand, the greatness of God which we experience - we have to become part of. That is what Akal means - deathlessness. 10/6/89|Yogi Bhajan|32787;;

Quote91;Text;Description (optional);You are designated as a human being for the destiny to become One. It is a very long, lonely road. Nobody else can travel on it with you, match up with you, understand you or be with you, because you are very special, made by the One in the image of One’s own self. For convenience, you call it “God.” 3/29/87|Yogi Bhajan|31865;;
Quote92;Text;Description (optional);We have to draw the line. Are we committed to the truth? And do we want to give ourselves a try this way? And do we want to realize during this lifetime the basic truth for which we have come on this Earth? Or do we just want to do what an ignorant man wants to do? One way is to live consciously. One way is to live unconsciously. Both ways are living. 6/18/73|Yogi Bhajan|26833;;

Quote94;Text;Description (optional);"It is a self-catering process, it is a self-disciplining process, it is a self-meditation into the total activity.

It’s a fundamental necessity; it is a must of the human life. 6/18/73|Yogi Bhajan|26833";;
Quote95;Text;Description (optional);Communication is a science and an art. Speak and answer if it boils down to that. But normally two people should just communicate by their presence.

Quote100;Text;Description (optional);A very courageous man, a very strong man, a very real man, can talk about peace. Peace doesn’t mean to just talk about peace, peace means we have to put all the pieces together and get to one picture. It’s a song of victory, it’s a song of God, it’s a song of reality. And as I have said, until this Earth stops revolving, if those born of a woman don’t know how to respect woman, there shall be no peace. Just imagine that Mother Earth is a woman. What have we done to it? We ourselves do not know. 8/17/89|Yogi Bhajan|32737;;
Quote101;Text;Description (optional);If you call me names, I’ll be very grateful, because it reminds me to lean on God more and understand Ang Sang Wahe Guru.

Quote102;Text;Description (optional);"It is very authentically, absolutely wrong when you judge a person because he is dishonest, he is corrupt, he is a thief, he is a felon, he is this and that.

Quote105;Text;Description (optional);"Mind has the power to take you to God and mind has the power to take you away from God. There is no other power. And it is a good polarity: What can take you to God can also take you away from God. That’s why they say there’s nothing good and nothing bad; thinking makes it so. It’s very true. You have to understand that. 7/17/84|Yogi Bhajan|30880";;

Quote107;Text;Description (optional);Never forget that you are one human race created by a Creator for experience, intuition and consciousness.

Quote111;Text;Description (optional);Mother Earth is crying in vain. Almighty God, who out of His many bountiful blessings, gave us the planet Earth which we have raped, abused, misused—and we are not stopping.

Quote113;Text;Description (optional);There are two guiding instincts in man. He is either improving his future or blocking his future improvement.

Quote114;Text;Description (optional);When you apply the mind it becomes engaged in the task or the experience you give it, so it won’t confront you. Talk to your mind.

Quote117;Text;Description (optional);When you think any thought, is it narrow-mindedness or is it infinite vastness? You are as great as you are vast.

Quote121;Text;Description (optional);"Life is spirit. The soul that teaches life, the moment it leaves, no weight is lost, you are gone. You are [here] as long as your spirit is, and as long as your soul is. Every day is a day of challenge: how much good have I done today? How kind was I? How many people have I inspired? How many people have I brought to laughter? How many people have I satisfied that they felt alive again? These things matter in life; they are what life is.

Quote127;Text;Description (optional);When you stand, take a stand, and stand tall. Walk tall and stand by the strength of your soul.
